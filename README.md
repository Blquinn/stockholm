# Stockholm

Stockholm is a collection of desktop-first widgets and themes designed to look and feel great on Mac and Windows. The widgets are familiar enough to be comfortable to use on any platform but avoid the uncanny valley by not aiming to replicate the native components exactly.

This library is primarily written for the [Serverpod](https://serverpod.dev) GUI. ([Serverpod](https://serverpod.dev) is the missing server for Flutter, go check it out!) Hence, the focus has been on the widgets required for Serverpod. If you find that some component is missing, please make a pull request.

There is not yet any documentation, but the [example project](https://github.com/serverpod/stockholm/tree/master/example/lib) shows how to use all widgets, and it's pretty straightforward. Make user to use the provided theme classes or the UI will not look good.
